**Objective:**

* The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly web application that allows users to easily access weather information for any city.

**Functionality:**

* Users enter a city name in a search bar.
* Clicking the "Search" button triggers a weather lookup for the entered city.
* The application fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, including current temperature, weather description, and an icon.
* It displays the retrieved information on the screen:
    * City name
    * Current temperature in Celsius (Â°C)
    * Weather description (e.g., cloudy, sunny)
    * Dynamic weather icon corresponding to the current weather conditions.
    * Humidity percentage.
    * Wind speed in kilometers per hour (Km/H).
    * If the entered city is not found, a friendly message and a relevant image (404 error) are displayed to inform the user.

**Technologies Used:**

* **HTML:** Defines the structure of the webpage, including the search bar, weather display sections, and error message.
* **CSS:** Styles the visual elements of the application, including layout, colors, typography, and image sizes.
* **JavaScript:** Provides interactivity, handling user input (search), fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, and dynamically updating the UI with weather information and error messages.
* **FontAwesome:** Icon library used for search and weather-related icons.

**External APIs:**

* **OpenWeatherMap API:** Provides real-time weather data for the specified location, including temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, and weather icons.

**Overall, this Weather App with JavaScript is designed to be a straightforward tool for checking weather conditions globally, offering clear and accessible information to users.**
